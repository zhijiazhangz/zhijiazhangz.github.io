<h1>Subgroups of the automorphism group of X<sub>3</sub></h1>

In particular, a subgroup of S<sub>6</sub> is linearizable if and only if
<ul>
<li> fixed any singular points and, or</li>
<li> is contained in the nonstandard S<sub>5</sub> and, or</li> 
<li> is isomorphic to C<sub>2</sub><sup>2</sup> and leaves three invariant planes in X<sub>3</sub>.
</ul>
There are 36 linearizable conjugacy classes, their indices in the subgroup lattice below are 
<pre>
[ 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 27, 28, 30, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 52, 53 ]
</pre>
