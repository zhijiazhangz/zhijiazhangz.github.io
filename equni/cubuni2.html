<h1>Equivariant unirationality of actions of groups with (possibly) non-isomorphic invariant smooth cubic threefolds</h1>
<br>

The following 41 groups may admit actions on non-isomorphic smooth cubic threefolds
<pre>
 S3,  D5,  D4,  D6,  A4,  C3:C4,  C3*S3,  C3:S3,  F5,  He3,  C3:D4,  S4,  C3*D4,  S3^2,  C3:S3.C2,  C6*S3,  C3*C3:C4,  C3*A4,  C3^2:S3,
 C3^2*S3,  C3*C3:S3,  C2*He3,  A5,  C3*He3,  S3wrC2,  C3*S4,  C3^3:C2^2,  C3*S3^2,  C3^2:(C3:C4),  C2*C3^2:S3,  C3*C3:S3.C2,  S5,
 S3*He3,  He3:S3,  C3*C3^2:S3,  S3^2:S3,  C3*S3wrC2,  S3*C3^2:S3,  C4*S3,  C3^2:S3.C2,  (C3*He3):C4.  
</pre>

We study equivariant unirationality of such actions. We use <A href="https://github.com/zhijiazhangz/zhijiazhangz.github.io/blob/main/equni/smoothcub1.magma">this code.</A>

The G-action on a smooth cubic threefold always fixes a point for the following G:
        <pre>
 D4, S4, C3*D4, C2*He3, C2*C3^2:S3, C4*S3, C3^2:S3.C2.  
</pre>

The G-action on a smooth cubic threefold always have an index 2 subgroup with fixed points on the cubic, for the following G:
        <pre>
D5, C3:D4.
</pre>

The G-action on a smooth cubic threefold always fails Condition (A) for the following G:
        <pre>
 C3:S3, S3^2, C3:S3.C2, C3*C3:S3, C3*He3, S3wrC2, C3^3:C2^2, C3*S3^2, 
C3^2:(C3:C4), C3*C3:S3.C2, S3*He3, He3:S3, C3*C3^2:S3, S3^2:S3, C3*S3wrC2, 
S3*C3^2:S3, (C3*He3):C4.
</pre>

The following groups admit actions with mixed situations described above (i.e., either an index-2 subgroup has fixed points or the action fail condition A)
<pre>
S3, D6, C3:C4, C3*S3, C6*S3, C3*C3:C4, He3, C3^2:S3, C3^2*S3
</pre>

For the remaining groups G, the G-action on a smooth cubic threefold always has a G-unirational invariant hyperplane section for the following G:
        <pre>
A4, F5, C3*A4, C3*S4, S5.
        </pre>

After these, we are only left with one group 
<pre>
A5.
</pre>

A5 have two representations with invariant smooth cubic threefold: one through the permutation actions on the coordinates, and always has a fixed point on the cubic. 
        The other through its irreducible 5-dimensional representations, which has a pencil of invariant smooth cubi threefolds. Equivariant unirationality of the latter case is open.
