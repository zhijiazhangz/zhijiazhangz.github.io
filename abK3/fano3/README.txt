Finding possibilities of Fano 3-folds with actions from abelian groups of K3 types
==============================================
The mail file is possible_baskets.magma 

==============================================
In a directory with all the files run

$ magma possible_baskets.magma

==============================================
We only contribute to the file possible_baskets.magma
Please see annotation in the file for more information. â€¨

All other files to find all numerical invariants of Fano threefolds are downloaded from 
The Graded Ring Database from the followin link

===============================================
For index 2 Fano threefolds, we checked possibilities by hand using the online database
