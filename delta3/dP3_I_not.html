Type I actions in Table 3 have been explained in details in the paper. The computation of cohomological invariants can be recovered by code <a ><a href="https://zhijiazhangz.github.io/delta3/dP3_I.magma">here</a>
<br>
<br>
Below, we display Type I actions not in Table 3, the reasons why they are not, and their generators
