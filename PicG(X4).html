<h1>Picard group of a desingularization of the Burkhardt quartic X<sub>4</sub></h1>
<br>
The Picard module of the blow-up of X<sub>4</sub> at its 45 singularities has been studied in

</ul>
Results on first cohomology are displayed in their paper. We display the subgroup lattice of PSp<sub>4</sub>(F<sub>3</sub>), and the corresponding list of G-invariant Picard groups of the desigularization of X4 below, also using <a ><a href="https://github.com/shiva-chid/code_rationality"> their codes</a>.
